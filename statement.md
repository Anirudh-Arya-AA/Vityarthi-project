1. Project TitleMovie Guessing Game CLI2. Problem StatementThe project addresses the need for a simple, accessible, and customizable interactive game that can be run directly from the command line. It provides a platform for users to test their movie trivia knowledge in an engaging format, while simultaneously serving as a straightforward learning exercise in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), input validation, and algorithmic logic (obfuscation/hinting) for developers.3. Scope of the ProjectThe project's scope is strictly defined to ensure a focused and achievable deliverable (a Python console application).3.1 In Scope (IN)Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI) only.Data Management: In-Memory Data—Movie lists are input and stored only for the current session.Error Handling: Basic text-based input validation and error handling for user inputs.Operation: Single-player, local operation.3.2 Out of Scope (OUT)Graphical User Interface (GUI) development (e.g., using Tkinter, PyQt).Database integration (SQL, NoSQL) or persistent storage (saving movie lists/scores to a file).Networked, multi-user, or online functionality.Complex security features or robust logging.4. Target UsersThe users for this project are categorized as follows:Primary Users (Casual Players): Individuals who enjoy movie trivia and desire a quick, easy-to-use game without needing to install complex software.Secondary Users (Students/Developers): Beginners learning Python who need a practical example of a modular, class-based program that manages user input and session state (score, streak, difficulty).5. High-Level FeaturesThe core capabilities of the application are:Feature NameDescriptionCustom Knowledge BaseAllows the user to input a dynamic list of movies, making the game content unique for every session.Dynamic Difficulty SelectionEnables the user to choose difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), which directly controls the percentage of characters hidden in the movie title.Points and Streak TrackingMaintains the session state, recording the score, number of correct answers, and the longest consecutive correct guess streak.Point-Deducting Hint SystemProvides a mechanic for players to spend existing points to reveal a single hidden letter in the mystery title.Obfuscation LogicThe algorithm responsible for randomly hiding letters in the movie title based on the selected difficulty percentage.
