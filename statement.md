Movie Guessing Game CLI🌟:  Project Overview & Problem StatementThis project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) game designed to test and improve movie trivia knowledge. It addresses the need for a simple, accessible, and highly customizable game platform that requires no external dependencies or complex installation.The core purpose is dual: to provide entertainment for casual users and to serve as a practical demonstration of fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python, showcasing clear state management (score, streaks) and algorithmic logic (obfuscation and hinting).
✨ Features: The application provides a variety of user-defined settings and mechanics:Custom Knowledge Base: The game begins by allowing the user to input a dynamic list of movies (the "Knowledge Base") for the session.Dynamic Difficulty: Players select from Easy, Medium, or Hard settings. This choice determines the percentage of letters hidden and applies a score multiplier for points earned.Point-Deducting Hint System: Players can type HINT during gameplay to reveal one hidden letter, deducting 5 points from their current score.Score and Streak Tracking: The game accurately tracks the total score, rounds played, and maintains a counter for the player's longest consecutive correct guess streak.Case-Insensitive Input: Guesses are normalized to ensure capitalization and minor spacing errors do not prevent a correct answer.
🛠️ Getting Started :  This project is built using standard Python libraries and is immediately runnable.Technologies UsedLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries: random, time (Standard Library)Installation & Run InstructionsSave the Code: Copy the entire Python script and save it locally as movie_game.py.Execute the Script: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and run:Bashpython movie_game.py
🗺️ Project Scope & Boundaries: The architecture is strictly Object-Oriented (class MovieGame) to manage session state. The project scope is limited to console operations.ScopeDescriptionIN SCOPECLI, In-Memory Data Storage (Session-only), Basic Input Validation.OUT OF SCOPEGraphical User Interfaces (GUIs), External Databases, Persistent Score Saving, Multi-User Functionality.
🧪 Testing Instructions: Follow these steps to quickly verify core gameplay and feature functionality:Start: Run python movie_game.py.Setup: Input a list of 3-4 movies (e.g., Jaws, Aliens, Predator).Difficulty Test: Select 3 (Hard).Hint Test: When the first mystery title appears, type HINT. Verify 5 points are deducted, and a letter is revealed.Score Test: Guess the next movie correctly. Verify the score increases significantly due to the Hard difficulty multiplier.Exit Test: When prompted again? (y/n):, type n. Verify the FINAL STATS screen appears and the script terminates.
